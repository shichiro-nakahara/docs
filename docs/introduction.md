Nata Network is the first private [ZK-rollup](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/) on [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), enabling decentralized applications to access privacy and scale. Nata Network's rollup is secured by its industry-standard [PLONK](https://cryptocurrencywiki.org/PLONK) proving mechanism used by the leading zero-knowledge scaling projects.

At Nata Network we believe decentralization is premised on individual rights. Without widely accessible privacy, we compromise our ability to choose how we live our lives and earn our livelihoods.

That’s why we’re building [Nata Network](https://natanetwork.io), to deliver privacy without compromise:

- __Private.__ Nata Network is the only zero-knowledge rollup built with a privacy-first architecture from the ground up.
- __Compliant.__ Our programmably private system supports opt-in auditability and compliance while fully preserving confidentiality.
