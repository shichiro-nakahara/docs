title: Deposit (Shield)

Deposit assets from Ethereum to Aztec.

The SDK comes with a `DepositController` that makes it easy to create and track deposit transactions from Ethereum to Aztec.

Deposits require sending Ethereum transactions from a user's account to the Aztec deposit contract. Any Etheruem account can make a deposit to any Aztec account.

An example to help clarify. Say Alice is an entity on L1 that wants to make a deposit of 10 DAI into Bob's account on Aztec. She knows that Bob owns the bob.eth ENS (Ethereum Name Service) name, so she can make a deposit like (ens inserted instead of address for clarity):

```js
aztecRollupContract.depositPendingFunds(1, 10e18, bob.eth, bytes32(0));
```

After this transaction is executed, there is now 10 DAI in Bob's pending balance on Aztec. Bob then creates a deposit proof (only on L2, no L1 transaction), where he uses the 10 DAI. Bob now has the 10 DAI in an Aztec account and he never sent a L1 tx himself. If there have been multiple deposits, he can make the deposit proof of the sum of them if he wants to, e.g., for 3 deposits of 10 DAI he could make a deposit proof spending all 30 DAI.

The SDK simplifies making deposits to the Aztec rollup contract as well as generating the proofs for claiming pending deposits.

You can find the interface for the `DepositController` class [here](../types/sdk/DefiController).

### Controller Setup

```ts
AztecSdk.createDepositController(
    depositor: EthAddress,          
    value: AssetValue,               
    fee: AssetValue,                  
    recipient: GrumpkinAddress,  
    recipientSpendingKeyRequired?: boolean,
    provider?: EthereumProvider)
        : Promise<DepositController>
```

### Controller Inputs

| Arguments | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| depositor | [EthAddress](../types/barretenberg/EthAddress) | Ethereum account making the deposit. |
| value | [AssetValue](../types/barretenberg/AssetValue) | Type and amount of deposit. |
| fee | [AssetValue](../types/barretenberg/AssetValue) | Type and amount for the Aztec transaction fee. |
| recipient | [GrupmkinAddress](../types/barretenberg/GrumpkinAddress) | The account public key of the Aztec account. |
| recipientSpendingKeyRequired? | boolean | Optional flag that specifies whether the recipient account should already be registered. |
| provider? | [EthereumProvider](../types/barretenberg/EthereumProvider) | Optional Ethereum Provider. When unspecified it defaults to the provider used in setup (`createAztecSdk`). |

#### Returns

| Return Type | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| [DepositController](../types/sdk/DepositController) | A user instance with apis bound to the user's account id. |

### Executing a Deposit

The complete deposit flow for Ether using the `DepositController` looks like this: 

```ts
const tokenAssetId = sdk.getAssetIdBySymbol('ETH');
const tokenDepositFee = (await sdk.getDepositFees(tokenAssetId))[
    settlementTime
];
const tokenAssetValue: AssetValue = {
    assetId: tokenAssetId,
    value: tokenQuantity,
};
const tokenDepositController = sdk.createDepositController(
    depositor,
    tokenAssetValue,
    tokenDepositFee,
    recipient,
    true,
);
await tokenDepositController.createProof();
await tokenDepositController.sign();
// check if there are pending deposits
if ((await tokenDepositController.getPendingFunds()) < tokenQuantity) {
    await tokenDepositController.depositFundsToContract();
    await tokenDepositController.awaitDepositFundsToContract();
}
let txId = await tokenDepositController.send();
```

Not all ERC-20s (specifically DAI) have correctly implemented the permit spec. So in the case of DAI you call `depositFundsToContractWithNonStandardPermit` instead of `depositFundsToContract`.

You can review the complete reference script [here](https://github.com/critesjosh/aztec-sdk-starter/blob/mainnet-fork/src/latest/shieldAssets.ts).

#### Required Approvals

When depositing an ERC-20 token like DAI, you will need to approve Aztec as an authorized spender before depositing. The `DepositController` includes a method for this, `DepositController.approve()` which will request approval for the amount required for the deposit.
