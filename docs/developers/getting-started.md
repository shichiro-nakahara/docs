## Building on Aztec

There are two common ways that developers can start building on Aztec:

1. Build a user-facing application that connects to the Aztec network via the TypeScript SDK.
2. Build an Aztec Connect bridge that connects the Aztec network to Ethereum smart contracts.

We are also working on Noir, an independent domain specific language that can be used to develop ZK-provable programs. Refer to the [Noir page](./noir) for more details.

The Aztec core engineering team has a regular release cadence that will occasionally introduce breaking changes. Updates are typically applied to Testnet on Thursdays, which are tested and monitored over the weekend and would be pushed to Mainnet afterwards.

We are working on making this process more transparent. Feel free to [get in touch](#get-in-touch) if you have any queries.

## Testnet Information

You can run a local development environment by following the instructions on [this page](./local-devnet).

We have a private testnet and access is reserved for people building products on Aztec. If you need access to the Aztec testing environment, please reach out via [email](mailto:devrel@aztecprotocol.com).

## Building with the SDK

### Setup

To start using the SDK, install it in your project by running:

```shell
yarn add @aztec/sdk
```

And import it into your project:

```ts
import { createAztecSdk } from "@aztec/sdk";
```

For a proper walkthrough of setting up the SDK, check the [SDK Setup page](../sdk/usage/setup.mdx).

### Example Code

To learn how the SDK works in action, the [CLI page](./cli) provides a detailed breakdown of the [Aztec CLI](https://github.com/critesjosh/azteccli) tool powered by the SDK.

If you are building a web interface, you might also find the [Frontend Boilerplate](https://github.com/Globallager/aztec-frontend-boilerplate) useful as a starting point.

:::tip
By default, Aztec transactions could take up to a few hours to settle on the Testnet like on Mainnet. If you want transactions to settle quickly, be sure to set `TxSettlementTime` as `INSTANT`.

`INSTANT` transactions pay higher fees in ETH in exchange for settlement within minutes rather than hours.

## Building an Aztec Connect Bridge Contract

The [Aztec Connect Bridges page](./bridges) covers how to develop an Aztec Connect Bridge in great detail.

The [Aztec Connect Bridges repository](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect-bridges) has the most up to date information and materials for creating a bridge contract.
