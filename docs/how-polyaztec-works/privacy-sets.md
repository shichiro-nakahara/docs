title: Infinite Privacy (Sets)
---

In the last article in our series on PolyAztec‚Äôs privacy architecture, we explored how a private network is even possible on a public blockchain.

Today we‚Äôre exploring why a private network is endlessly more private than simple solutions like privacy mixers.

Just like mixers, PolyAztec offers basic deposits and withdrawals ‚Äî meant to break the link between a sending address and receiving address.

But PolyAztec also offers private internal transfers.

The addition of these anonymizing activities means PolyAztec will offer a large and dynamic privacy set that will become increasingly more difficult to de-anonymize ‚Äîa concept we like to call Infinite Privacy.

## The Infinite City

Imagine PolyAztec as a walled city. All an outside observer can see is users entering and leaving PolyAztec via our bridge.

Within the walls of the city, users can exchange assets with fully private transactions. Neither the network nor its participants can see the senders and recipients of transactions, nor their amounts.

In addition, once inside the system, users can batch transactions and teleport back to Polygon ‚Äî to swap, stake for yield, lend funds, vote in DAOs, or buy NFTs.

Because PolyAztec allows for these two new anonymizing activities ‚Äî internal transactions and batched interactions with Polygon‚Äî the privacy set is significantly harder for an observer to calculate than, for instance, on a privacy mixer without those features.

That‚Äôs a very good thing.

## Sleuthing and Deducing

Let‚Äôs put ourselves in the shoes of an adversary attempting to run de-anonymizing transaction graph analysis.

As an observer watching Polygon activity, we might watch deposits to and from PolyAztec, and attempt to deduce what set of deposits a certain withdrawal might belong to.

This is what we mean by privacy or anonymity set ‚Äî the group or set of users a forensic target could be. If the privacy set the target belongs to is large, then we can only guess with a small probability which addresses and transactions the target is associated with.

Once the privacy set you belong to approaches 1, the probability an observer knows who you are also approaches 1, and your privacy is no longer protected.

Let‚Äôs talk through an example.

## Anonymity Sets 101: Mixer Math

Pretend PolyAztec were a simple privacy mixer without internal transactions, and we were internet sleuths trying to de-anonymize the network üïµ.Ô∏è

If we saw someone withdraw 1 MATIC, we‚Äôd know for certain that they‚Äôd deposited at least 1 MATIC into the mixer. Because there are no internal transfers, aggregation of multiple deposits into a larger withdrawal simply isn‚Äôt possible.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù we‚Äôd puzzle, ‚Äúall we need to figure out is how many people have ever deposited at least 1 MATIC, and then the withdrawer must be one of those people!‚Äù

## The privacy set in a world without internal transfers.

Of course, the probability that a 1-MATIC withdrawer came from the 1 MATIC deposit set is much higher than the probability that she came from the >1 MATIC deposit set, for a purely behavioral reason:

It‚Äôs annoying to break 5-, 10-, or 30-MATIC deposits into smaller 1 MATIC withdrawals. It‚Äôs much simpler to do one big monolithic withdrawal.

So as sophisticated sleuths, our investigative instincts would say that there is some non-zero but small probability that the withdrawer deposited an amount >1 MATIC, with that probability diminishing for larger deposits.

This is an example of a simple probability distribution ‚Äî and the ‚Äúspikier‚Äù it is, the more certainty an adversary has about user behaviors.

In this case, based on observations of other privacy mixers and other comparable behaviors on Defi, a forensic analyst might think the probability of a 1 MATIC withdrawal coming from a 5 MATIC deposit is 5x lower than the probability of a 1 MATIC withdrawal coming from a 1 MATIC deposit.

## Standing In or Standing Out

Let‚Äôs establish a rough heuristic guide to thinking about privacy sets:

In order to figure out how to blend in, figure out how to stand out, and then do the opposite.

The most obvious way for me to stand out in the case without internal transactions would be if I bridged a massive monolithic deposit and withdrew the same amount shortly afterward.

To make myself even more highly identifiable, I would use a unique quantity of a certain asset (e.g. depositing 69.696969 MATIC to PolyAztec, then subsequently withdrawing 69.696969 MATIC). To prevent de-anonymizing behavior, the PolyAztec front-end suggests round-number deposits and withdrawals ‚Äî so you don‚Äôt stand out.

As users what we want to do is introduce uncertainty into any forensic analysis. Keen observers should feel frustrated by our actions. They should say something like, ‚ÄúDang, calculating the probability that these two addresses are affiliated is so complex and low-probability that it‚Äôs not meaningful for me to try to figure out which deposit is related to which withdrawal.‚Äù

I sum our conclusions in this extremely sophisticated 2x2 matrix of behaviors:

## Very. Sophisticated.

So given what we know, how as a collective can we introduce more uncertainty into the adversary‚Äôs analysis?

Increase the size of each deposit set, especially large deposits
‚ÄúSpread out‚Äù the probability that the withdrawal could have come from any deposit set!
Simple mixers focus on #1. Let‚Äôs talk about what #2 adds.

### Internal Transfers: The Inner Sanctum

There is a big caveat here that differentiates our current PolyAztec front-end from mixers ‚Äî there is a possibility that your anonymity set includes deposits that are smaller than your withdrawal amount.

How? Because internal transfers.

Say you withdraw 10 MATIC. You could have deposited 10 MATIC.

Or you could have deposited 5 MATIC, used or coordinated offchain with 5 unassociated addresses to deposit and send you 1 MATIC each internally, and then in the end withdrew 10 MATIC. Suddenly you could be, well, pretty much anyone, so long as two things hold:

The amount of assets in the system is sufficient to support the hypothetical withdrawal scenario.
The number of transactions in the intervening time exceeds the number needed to compose the hypothetical withdrawal scenario.
So in this case, you could be some combination of internal transactions summing to 10E:

* 10 internal 1E transfers
* 100 internal 0.1E transfers
* 1,000 internal 0.01E transfers
* Some combination of the above

Of course, as the number of internal transfers needed to sum to a withdrawal amount increases, the less likely it actually happened ‚Äî realistically, who‚Äôs going to coordinate 1,000 unaffiliated addresses to privately send them funds!

That‚Äôs why the internal economy of PolyAztec matters.

Internal transfers muddy up anonymity set calculations, but only if there are a sufficient number of internal transfers and a large enough quantity of deposits in the system.

## Purify Before Entering

Now, what PolyAztec doesn‚Äôt do is protect users on mainnet, and poor security hygiene on Polygon can hurt user privacy.

But there‚Äôs some good news here ‚Äî simply follow privacy best-practices.

Let‚Äôs start with one of the biggest no-no‚Äôs for any privacy preservation system: withdrawing to the same address.

**Don‚Äôt do this.**

Why is withdrawing to the same address ‚Äúbad?‚Äù In addition to reducing your own anonymity, you‚Äôre basically screwing everyone else over. You‚Äôre reducing the anonymity set by removing yourself from it, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking my ball back.‚Äù

Now there‚Äôs no way your deposit could actually be the source of anyone else‚Äôs withdrawal but your own!

While PolyAztec isn‚Äôt a mixer, this analogy might help clear things up:

Everyone chucks their balls into a giant ball pit. Now we play in the ball pit, trading balls, mixing them up, splashing around. And at the end of the day, everyone takes a ball and goes home.

It‚Äôs unclear who brought and took home which balls, right?

Withdrawing to the same address you deposited is akin to saying, ‚ÄúThis is the ball I brought! It‚Äôs special because my mommy gave it to me.‚Äù Okay Jimmy, that‚Äôs fine, but imagine if everyone did that. If everyone identified themselves and their funds, it would:

* Defeat the purpose of using private transfers in the first place
* Harm everyone else‚Äôs ability to blend in!

Now consider the inverse: a large number of addresses deposit, and a large number (but not the same!) addresses withdraw. Now we‚Äôd have a very hard time associating one wallet with another.

Critically, any transaction graph analysis on Polygon may be able to associate those accounts and therefore collapse many addresses. Depositing to PolyAztec and withdrawing to an address already associated with the depository address is akin to withdrawing to the same address. That‚Äôs why withdrawals should only happen to untouched or otherwise unaffiliated wallets.

## Hygiene takeaways:

* Use common deposit and withdrawal amounts
* Avoid making large deposits or large withdrawals (though large withdrawals are worse)
* Don‚Äôt withdraw to the same address you deposited to

Remember that internal transfers are always fully privacy protected and do NOT require privacy set considerations!
