# Troubleshooting Guide

## Account Not Registered Error

Most "Account Not Registered" errors can be resolved with one of two methods:

1. Double-checking your Ethereum address. Please connect to zk.money using the Ethereum address you used to sign up for your alias.

2. Mistyping or misremembering your alias. Remember that your alias is critical to access your account and forgetting or misplacing it means you may not be able to access your funds.

If either approach does not work, you may belong to one of the below cohorts whose account aliases were not migrated:

1. Users who registered **prior** to July, 2021 but **did not do an account migration in the old system**. From July, 2021 to June, 2022, accounts were required to undergo [a security update](june2021update.md). If you did not update prior to June, 2022, your alias is inaccessible in the new system. This includes users who attempted migration on old.zk.money after June, 2022.

2. Users who forgot their alias after June, 2022 and had to go through the "Forgot alias" flow on old.zk.money. If you forgot your alias for old.zk.money and recovered your account using the "Forgot alias" flow, including registering a new alias, the new alias will NOT be migrated. Your old (forgotten) alias **has** been migrated if you want to try remembering it in the new system.
