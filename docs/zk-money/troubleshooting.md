# Troubleshooting Guide

### Hung on "Connecting to Rollup Provider" on sign-up or log-in

You may be presented with an "AbortError: Transaction Aborted" when attempted to sign up or log-in after a system update.

In that case, navigate to your browser console (F12 or Alt-Cmd-J) and the Application tab on the top bar. Once there, click "Storage" under the "Application" group and click "Clear site data." Refresh the page.
