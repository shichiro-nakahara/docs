# Earn/Loyalty Program

## Overview
NATA tokens are rewarded to users that perform a deposit in the ZK-rollup block.

Tokens are allocated portionally across the three asset pools (MATIC/WETH/DAI).

For each asset, tokens are rewarded to users with the largest deposit.

Each block will have rewards until the 30% allocation is gone or the DAO votes to stop the program.

## Maximize NATA Rewards
A user can earn the max per block by depositing the protocol limit for each of the three available assets (MATIC/WETH/DAI). 

## Epoch and Claiming Token Rewards
Once the current epoch has completed, users can claim the NATA tokens for the previous epoch. Epochs are 14 days long. 

## Allocating Token Rewards 
To ensure the three depositable asset pools are growing at the same rate, token reward allocations can be adjusted before the start of the next epoch. The governing DAO could be responsible for this.
