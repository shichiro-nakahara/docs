## MUST READ FOR AIRDROP 
Airdropped users must participate in each Earn Epoch to avoid having their token allocation reduced. 

## eNATA -> NATA 
The protocol will distrubute eNATA tokens which are non-transferable. At the end of the loyality program, users can redeem $eNATA for $NATA. The reason for this is to ensure the governance tokens are going to participants that use the protocol regularly. We want to reduce the amount of tokens going to airdrop farmers by requiring airdropped users to participate in the loyalty program.
