# Introduction

Welcome to Nata Router!

Here you can find all information about Nata Router and how to use it safely. We recommend going through the docs before using the app.

## Overview

Nata Router is a multichain privacy bridge powered by Stargate, LayerZero, Across Protocol and Nata Network.

Users can privately bridge tokens cross-chain and protect their transaction data from the public. Shielding a token means having it under a zkSNARK (zero-knowledge proof cryptography) shield that protects the userâ€™s privacy. The docs refer to 'Shielding' and 'Depositing' interchangeably.

## Benefits 

Nata users don't have to worry about having their address tainted by using a privacy app because the funds are proxied through the bridge smart contracts. This allows users to withdraw funds from Nata Network directly to their CEX address. 

Nata users on any chain are able to receive very strong privacy because all users, across all chains, share the same global privacy set. Other privacy protocols have separate contract deployments for each chain, resulting in a weaker privacy set for their users.

As LayerZero/Stargate and Across supports new chains, Nata Network can quickly and easily integrate them into the Router, instantly bootstrapping a large existing privacy set for the new chain.
