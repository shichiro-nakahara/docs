# Introduction

Welcome to Cross-Chain Nata Router!

Here you can find all information about Nata Router and how to use it safely. We recommend going through the docs before using the app.

## Overview

Nata Router is a cross-chain privacy bridge powered by Stargate, LayerZero, and Nata Network.

Users can privately bridge tokens cross-chain and protect their transaction data from the public. Shielding a token means having it under a zkSNARK (zero-knowledge proof cryptography) shield that protects the userâ€™s privacy. The docs refer to 'Shielding' and 'Depositing' interchangeably.
