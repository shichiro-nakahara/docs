## Frequently Asked Questions
### What is zkETH/zkDAI?

zkETH is a shielded ETH token, which has a zkSNARK layer that protects its transaction data. zkETH has the same behaviour as regular ETH, and users can send it to any Ethereum address from zk.money. The same concept applies to other assets on the platform.

### Does Aztec have a token?

We think it's important to build an amazing product before we think about building in a token economics. Decentralization is a key part of our roadmap, but in the short term we are just focusing on the product and expanding zk.money to work with private DeFi, so are not currently thinking about a token.
